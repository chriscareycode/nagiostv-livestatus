NagiosTV MK Livestatus Edition

![Display](http://chriscarey.com/projects/nagiostv/images/nagiostv-livestatus-1.png)

Featuring:
 EmberJS
 Animate.css
 FlynnCSS

I'm checking this in so it can be easily deployed to some remote test machines as development continues.

Got EmberJS up to 1.4.0 but it needs some serious cleanup still

CSS needs major overhaul as well.

I threw in FlynnCSS and some fun animate.css as a teaser.

Alpha quality code. A work in progress.
